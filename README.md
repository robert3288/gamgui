# gamgui
GAM GUI provides a graphical user interface for generating and running GAM commands. It includes commonly used commands for managing devices and users in Google Workspace, managing files in Google Drive, and creating user reports.

GAM for Windows must be installed, and the directory containing gam.exe must be included in the system or user's Path environment variable so it can be run from any location without specifying its full path.

Pressing Enter in any text box will show the command.
Pressing Shift + Enter in any text box will run the command.
